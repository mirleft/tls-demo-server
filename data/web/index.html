    <h1>OCaml-TLS demo server</h1>
    <p>
      When connecting to a secure site (http<strong>s</strong>://), your browser
      automatically initiates a secure connection
      using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">
        transport layer security (TLS)
      </a>.
      The sequence diagram below shows you the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake">
        TLS handshake
      </a> that <em>just</em> took place when your browser connected to this web
      server. We traced it using
      our <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls">OCaml-TLS</a>
      implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dotted lines represent unencrypted messages, while the solid
      lines indicate encrypted messages. Clicking on a message
      shows details about the exchanged data and the corresponding
      section of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">RFC 5246
        (TLS-1.2)</a> specification. Subsequent messages of the same type are
      condensed (marked with '*').

        Request</em> message to the client, and

<h3>7.1.  Change Cipher Spec Protocol</h3>

<p>The change cipher spec protocol exists to signal transitions in ciphering strategies.  The protocol consists of a single message, which is encrypted and compressed under the current (not the pending) connection state.  The message consists of a single byte of value 1.
</p>

<pre>
struct {
  enum { change_cipher_spec(1), (255) } type;
} ChangeCipherSpec;
</pre>

<p>
The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent by both the client and the server to notify the receiving party that subsequent records will be protected under the newly negotiated CipherSpec and keys.  Reception of this message causes the receiver to instruct the record layer to immediately copy the read pending state into the read current state. Immediately after sending this message, the sender MUST instruct the record layer to make the write pending state the write active state. (See Section 6.1.) The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent during the handshake after the security parameters have been agreed upon, but before the verifying Finished message is sent.
</p>

<p>
Note: If a rehandshake occurs while data is flowing on a connection, the communicating parties may continue to send data using the old CipherSpec.  However, once the ChangeCipherSpec has been sent, the new CipherSpec MUST be used.  The first side to send the ChangeCipherSpec does not know that the other side has finished computing the new keying material (e.g., if it has to perform a time-consuming public key operation).  Thus, a small window of time, during which the recipient must buffer the data, MAY exist.  In practice, with modern machines this interval is likely to be fairly short.

              <h3>7.4.1.1.  Hello Request</h3>
<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>
The HelloRequest message MAY be sent by the server at any time.
</p>

<h4>Meaning of this message:</h4>

<p>
HelloRequest is a simple notification that the client should begin the negotiation process anew.  In response, the client should send a ClientHello message when convenient.  This message is not intended to establish which side is the client or server but merely to initiate a new negotiation.  Servers SHOULD NOT send a HelloRequest immediately upon the client's initial connection.  It is the client's job to send a ClientHello at that time.
</p>

<p>
This message will be ignored by the client if the client is currently negotiating a session.  This message MAY be ignored by the client if it does not wish to renegotiate a session, or the client may, if it wishes, respond with a no_renegotiation alert. Since handshake messages are intended to have transmission precedence over application data, it is expected that the negotiation will begin before no more than a few records are
received from the client.  If the server sends a HelloRequest but does not receive a ClientHello in response, it may close the connection with a fatal alert.
</p>

<p>
After sending a HelloRequest, servers SHOULD NOT repeat the request until the subsequent handshake negotiation is complete.
</p>

<h4>Structure of this message:</h4>

<pre>
struct { } HelloRequest;
</pre>

<p>This message MUST NOT be included in the message hashes that are maintained throughout the handshake and used in the Finished messages and the certificate verify message.</p>
</div>
</para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-1-2"><div>
<h3>7.4.1.2.  Client Hello</h3>

<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>When a client first connects to a server, it is required to send the ClientHello as its first message.  The client can also send a ClientHello in response to a HelloRequest or on its own initiative in order to renegotiate the security parameters in an existing connection.</p>

<h4>Structure of this message:</h4>

<p>The ClientHello message includes a random structure, which is used later in the protocol.</p>

<pre>
struct {
  uint32 gmt_unix_time;
  opaque random_bytes[28];
} Random;
</pre>

<em>gmt_unix_time</em>
<p>The current time and date in standard UNIX 32-bit format (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, UTC, ignoring leap seconds) according to the sender's internal clock.  Clocks are not required to be set correctly by the basic TLS protocol; higher-level or application protocols may define additional requirements.  Note that, for historical reasons, the data element is named using GMT, the predecessor of the current worldwide time base, UTC.</p>

<em>random_bytes</em>
<p>28 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.</p>

<p>The ClientHello message includes a variable-length session identifier.  If not empty, the value identifies a session between the same client and server whose security parameters the client wishes to reuse.  The session identifier MAY be from an earlier connection, this connection, or from another currently active connection.  The second option is useful if the client only wishes to update the random structures and derived values of a connection, and the third option makes it possible to establish several independent secure connections without repeating the full handshake protocol.  These independent connections may occur sequentially or simultaneously; a SessionID becomes valid when the handshake negotiating it completes with the exchange of Finished messages and persists until it is removed due to aging or because a fatal error was encountered on a connection associated with the session.  The actual contents of the SessionID are defined by the server.</p>

<pre>
opaque SessionID<0..32>;
</pre>

<p>Warning: Because the SessionID is transmitted without encryption or immediate MAC protection, servers MUST NOT place confidential information in session identifiers or let the contents of fake session identifiers cause any breach of security.  (Note that the content of the handshake as a whole, including the SessionID, is protected by the Finished messages exchanged at the end of the handshake.)</p>

<p>The cipher suite list, passed from the client to the server in the ClientHello message, contains the combinations of cryptographic algorithms supported by the client in order of the client's preference (favorite choice first).  Each cipher suite defines a key exchange algorithm, a bulk encryption algorithm (including secret key length), a MAC algorithm, and a PRF.  The server will select a cipher suite or, if no acceptable choices are presented, return a handshake failure alert and close the connection.  If the list contains cipher suites the server does not recognize, support, or wish to use, the server MUST ignore those cipher suites, and process the remaining ones as usual.</p>

<pre>
uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */
</pre>

<p>The ClientHello includes a list of compression algorithms supported by the client, ordered according to the client's preference.</p>

<pre>
enum { null(0), (255) } CompressionMethod;

struct {
  ProtocolVersion client_version;
  Random random;
  SessionID session_id;
  CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
  CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
  select (extensions_present) {
    case false:
      struct {};
    case true:
      Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
  };
} ClientHello;
</pre>

<p>TLS allows extensions to follow the compression_methods field in an extensions block.  The presence of extensions can be detected by determining whether there are bytes following the compression_methods at the end of the ClientHello.  Note that this method of detecting optional data differs from the normal TLS method of having a variable-length field, but it is used for compatibility with TLS before extensions were defined.</p>

<em>client_version</em>
<p>The version of the TLS protocol by which the client wishes to communicate during this session.  This SHOULD be the latest (highest valued) version supported by the client.  For this version of the specification, the version will be 3.3 (see Appendix E for details about backward compatibility).</p>

<em>random</em>
<p>A client-generated random structure.</p>

<em>session_id</em>
<p>The ID of a session the client wishes to use for this connection. This field is empty if no session_id is available, or if the client wishes to generate new security parameters.</p>

<em>cipher_suites</em>
<p>This is a list of the cryptographic options supported by the client, with the client's first preference first.  If the session_id field is not empty (implying a session resumption request), this vector MUST include at least the cipher_suite from that session.  Values are defined in Appendix A.5.</p>

<em>compression_methods</em>
<p>This is a list of the compression methods supported by the client, sorted by client preference.  If the session_id field is not empty (implying a session resumption request), it MUST include the compression_method from that session.  This vector MUST contain, and all implementations MUST support, CompressionMethod.null. Thus, a client and server will always be able to agree on a compression method.</p>

<em>extensions</em>
<p>Clients MAY request extended functionality from servers by sending data in the extensions field.  The actual "Extension" format is defined in Section 7.4.1.4.</p>

<p>In the event that a client requests additional functionality using extensions, and this functionality is not supplied by the server, the client MAY abort the handshake.  A server MUST accept ClientHello messages both with and without the extensions field, and (as for all other messages) it MUST check that the amount of data in the message precisely matches one of these formats; if not, then it MUST send a fatal "decode_error" alert.</p>

<p>After sending the ClientHello message, the client waits for a ServerHello message.  Any handshake message returned by the server, except for a HelloRequest, is treated as a fatal error.</p>

<h3>7.4.1.3.  Server Hello</h3?

<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello message when it was able to find an acceptable set of algorithms. If it cannot find such a match, it will respond with a handshake failure alert.</p>

<h4>Structure of this message:</h4>

<pre>
struct {
  ProtocolVersion server_version;
  Random random;
  SessionID session_id;
  CipherSuite cipher_suite;
  CompressionMethod compression_method;
  select (extensions_present) {
    case false:
      struct {};
    case true:
      Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
  };
} ServerHello;
</pre>

<p>The presence of extensions can be detected by determining whether there are bytes following the compression_method field at the end of the ServerHello.</p>

<em>server_version</em>
<p>This field will contain the lower of that suggested by the client in the client hello and the highest supported by the server.  For this version of the specification, the version is 3.3.  (See Appendix E for details about backward compatibility.)</p>

<em>random</em>
<p>This structure is generated by the server and MUST be independently generated from the ClientHello.random.</p>

<em>session_id</em>
<p>This is the identity of the session corresponding to this connection.  If the ClientHello.session_id was non-empty, the server will look in its session cache for a match.  If a match is found and the server is willing to establish the new connection using the specified session state, the server will respond with the same value as was supplied by the client.  This indicates a resumed session and dictates that the parties must proceed directly to the Finished messages.  Otherwise, this field will contain a different value identifying the new session.  The server may return an empty session_id to indicate that the session will not be cached and therefore cannot be resumed.  If a session is resumed, it must be resumed using the same cipher suite it was originally negotiated with.  Note that there is no requirement that the server resume any session even if it had formerly provided a session_id.  Clients MUST be prepared to do a full negotiation -- including negotiating new cipher suites -- during any handshake.</p>

<em>cipher_suite</em>
<p>The single cipher suite selected by the server from the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites.  For resumed sessions, this field is the value from the state of the session being resumed.</p>

<em>compression_method</em>
<p>The single compression algorithm selected by the server from the list in ClientHello.compression_methods.  For resumed sessions, this field is the value from the resumed session state.</p>

<em>extensions</em>
<p>A list of extensions.  Note that only extensions offered by the client can appear in the server's list.</p>

<h3>7.4.2.  Server Certificate</h3>

<h4>When this message will be sent:<h4>

<p>The server MUST send a Certificate message whenever the agreed-upon key exchange method uses certificates for authentication (this includes all key exchange methods defined in this document except DH_anon).  This message will always immediately follow the ServerHello message.</p>

<h4>Meaning of this message:</h4>

<p>This message conveys the server's certificate chain to the client.</p>

<p>The certificate MUST be appropriate for the negotiated cipher suite's key exchange algorithm and any negotiated extensions.</p>

<h4>Structure of this message:</h4>

<pre>
opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

struct {
  ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
} Certificate;
</pre>

<em>certificate_list</em>
<p>This is a sequence (chain) of certificates.  The sender's certificate MUST come first in the list.  Each following certificate MUST directly certify the one preceding it.  Because certificate validation requires that root keys be distributed independently, the self-signed certificate that specifies the root certificate authority MAY be omitted from the chain, under the assumption that the remote end must already possess it in order to validate it in any case.</p>

<p>The same message type and structure will be used for the client's response to a certificate request message.  Note that a client MAY send no certificates if it does not have an appropriate certificate to send in response to the server's authentication request.</p>

<p>Note: PKCS #7 [PKCS7] is not used as the format for the certificate vector because PKCS #6 [PKCS6] extended certificates are not used. Also, PKCS #7 defines a SET rather than a SEQUENCE, making the task of parsing the list more difficult.</p>

<p>The following rules apply to the certificates sent by the server:</p>

<ul>
<li>The certificate type MUST be X.509v3, unless explicitly negotiated otherwise (e.g., [TLSPGP]).</li>
<li>The end entity certificate's public key (and associated restrictions) MUST be compatible with the selected key exchange algorithm.

<table border="0">
<tr>
<th>Key Exchange Alg.</th>
<th>Certificate Key Type</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RSA RSA_PSK</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>DHE_RSA ECDHE_RSA</td>
<td>RSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the key to be used for signing (the digitalSignature bit MUST be set if the key usage extension is present) with the signature scheme and hash algorithm that will be employed in the server key exchange message. Note: ECDHE_RSA is defined in [TLSECC].</td>

<td>ECDSA-capable public key; the certificate MUST allow the key to be used for signing with the hash algorithm that will be employed in the server key exchange message.  The public key MUST use a curve and point format supported by the client, as described in  [TLSECC].</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>

<li>The "server_name" and "trusted_ca_keys" extensions [TLSEXT] are used to guide certificate selection.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the client provided a "signature_algorithms" extension, then all certificates provided by the server MUST be signed by a hash/signature algorithm pair that appears in that extension.  Note that this implies that a certificate containing a key for one signature algorithm MAY be signed using a different signature algorithm (for instance, an RSA key signed with a DSA key).  This is a departure from TLS 1.1, which required that the algorithms be the same.  Note that this also implies that the DH_DSS, DH_RSA, ECDH_ECDSA, and ECDH_RSA key exchange algorithms do not restrict the algorithm used to sign the certificate.  Fixed DH certificates MAY be signed with any hash/signature algorithm pair appearing in the extension.  The names DH_DSS, DH_RSA, ECDH_ECDSA, and ECDH_RSA are historical.</p>

<p>If the server has multiple certificates, it chooses one of them based on the above-mentioned criteria (in addition to other criteria, such as transport layer endpoint, local configuration and preferences, etc.).  If the server has a single certificate, it SHOULD attempt to validate that it meets these criteria.</p>

<p>Note that there are certificates that use algorithms and/or algorithm combinations that cannot be currently used with TLS.  For example, a certificate with RSASSA-PSS signature key (id-RSASSA-PSS OID in SubjectPublicKeyInfo) cannot be used because TLS defines no corresponding signature algorithm.</p>

<p>As cipher suites that specify new key exchange methods are specified for the TLS protocol, they will imply the certificate format and the required encoded keying information.</p>

          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-3"><div>
<h3>7.4.3.  Server Key Exchange Message</h3>

<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>This message will be sent immediately after the server Certificate message (or the ServerHello message, if this is an anonymous negotiation).</p>

<p>The ServerKeyExchange message is sent by the server only when the server Certificate message (if sent) does not contain enough data to allow the client to exchange a premaster secret.  This is true for the following key exchange methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>DHE_DSS</li>
<li>DHE_RSA</li>
<li>DH_anon</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not legal to send the ServerKeyExchange message for the following key exchange methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSA</li>
<li>DH_DSS</li>
<li>DH_RSA</li>
</ul>

<p>Other key exchange algorithms, such as those defined in [TLSECC], MUST specify whether the ServerKeyExchange message is sent or not; and if the message is sent, its contents.</p>

<h4>Meaning of this message:</h4>

<p>This message conveys cryptographic information to allow the client to communicate the premaster secret: a Diffie-Hellman public key with which the client can complete a key exchange (with the result being the premaster secret) or a public key for some other algorithm.</p>

<h4>Structure of this message:</h4>

<pre>
enum { dhe_dss, dhe_rsa, dh_anon, rsa, dh_dss, dh_rsa

    opaque dh_g<1..2^16-1>;
    opaque dh_Ys<1..2^16-1>;
} ServerDHParams;     /* Ephemeral DH parameters */

dh_p
   The prime modulus used for the Diffie-Hellman operation.

dh_g
   The generator used for the Diffie-Hellman operation.

dh_Ys
   The server's Diffie-Hellman public value (g^X mod p).

struct {

        /* may be extended, e.g., for ECDH -- see [TLSECC] */
    };
} ServerKeyExchange;
</pre>

<em>params</em>
<p>The server's key exchange parameters.</p>

<em>signed_params</em>
<p>For non-anonymous key exchanges, a signature over the server's key exchange parameters.</p>

<p>If the client has offered the "signature_algorithms" extension, the signature algorithm and hash algorithm MUST be a pair listed in that extension.  Note that there is a possibility for inconsistencies here.  For instance, the client might offer DHE_DSS key exchange but omit any DSA pairs from its "signature_algorithms" extension.  In order to negotiate correctly, the server MUST check any candidate cipher suites against the "signature_algorithms" extension before selecting them.  This is somewhat inelegant but is a compromise designed to minimize changes to the original cipher suite design.</p>

<p>In addition, the hash and signature algorithms MUST be compatible with the key in the server's end-entity certificate.  RSA keys MAY be used with any permitted hash algorithm, subject to restrictions in the certificate, if any.</p>

<p>Because DSA signatures do not contain any secure indication of hash algorithm, there is a risk of hash substitution if multiple hashes may be used with any key.  Currently, DSA [DSS] may only be used with SHA-1.  Future revisions of DSS [DSS-3] are expected to allow the use of other digest algorithms with DSA, as well as guidance as to which digest algorithms should be used with each key size.  In addition, future revisions of [PKIX] may specify mechanisms for certificates to indicate which digest algorithms are to be used with DSA.</p>

<p>As additional cipher suites are defined for TLS that include new key exchange algorithms, the server key exchange message will be sent if and only if the certificate type associated with the key exchange algorithm does not provide enough information for the client to exchange a premaster secret.</p>

<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>The ServerHelloDone message is sent by the server to indicate the end of the ServerHello and associated messages.  After sending this message, the server will wait for a client response.</p>

<h4>Meaning of this message:</h4>

<p>This message means that the server is done sending messages to support the key exchange, and the client can proceed with its phase of the key exchange.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the ServerHelloDone message, the client SHOULD verify that the server provided a valid certificate, if required, and check that the server hello parameters are acceptable.</p>

<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>This message is always sent by the client.  It MUST immediately follow the client certificate message, if it is sent.  Otherwise, it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives the ServerHelloDone message.</p>

<h4>Meaning of this message:</h4>

<p>With this message, the premaster secret is set, either by direct transmission of the RSA-encrypted secret or by the transmission of Diffie-Hellman parameters that will allow each side to agree upon the same premaster secret.</p>

<p>When the client is using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponent, then this message contains the client's Diffie-Hellman public value.  If the client is sending a certificate containing a static DH exponent (i.e., it is doing fixed_dh client authentication), then this message MUST be sent but MUST be empty.</p>

<h4>When this message will be sent:</h4>

<p>A Finished message is always sent immediately after a change cipher spec message to verify that the key exchange and authentication processes were successful.  It is essential that a change cipher spec message be received between the other handshake messages and the Finished message.</p>

<h4>Meaning of this message:</h4>

<p>The Finished message is the first one protected with the just negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets.  Recipients of Finished messages MUST verify that the contents are correct.  Once a side has sent its Finished message and received and validated the Finished message from its peer, it may begin to send and receive application data over the connection.</p>

<h4>Structure of this message:</h4>

} Finished;
</pre>

<em>verify_data</em>
<p>PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages)) [0..verify_data_length-1];</p>

<em>finished_label</em>
<p>For Finished messages sent by the client, the string "client finished".  For Finished messages sent by the server, the string "server finished".</p>

<p>Hash denotes a Hash of the handshake messages.  For the PRF defined in Section 5, the Hash MUST be the Hash used as the basis for the PRF.  Any cipher suite which defines a different PRF MUST also define the Hash to use in the Finished computation.</p>

<p>In previous versions of TLS, the verify_data was always 12 octets long.  In the current version of TLS, it depends on the cipher suite.  Any cipher suite which does not explicitly specify verify_data_length has a verify_data_length equal to 12.  This includes all existing cipher suites.  Note that this representation has the same encoding as with previous versions. Future cipher suites MAY specify other lengths but such length MUST be at least 12 bytes.</p>

<em>handshake_messages</em>
<p>All of the data from all messages in this handshake (not including any HelloRequest messages) up to, but not including, this message.  This is only data visible at the handshake layer and does not include record layer headers.  This is the concatenation of all the Handshake structures as defined in Section 7.4, exchanged thus far.</p>

<p>It is a fatal error if a Finished message is not preceded by a ChangeCipherSpec message at the appropriate point in the handshake.</p>

<p>The value handshake_messages includes all handshake messages starting at ClientHello up to, but not including, this Finished message.  This may be different from handshake_messages in Section 7.4.8 because it would include the CertificateVerify message (if sent).  Also, the handshake_messages for the Finished message sent by the client will be different from that for the Finished message sent by the server, because the one that is sent second will include the prior one.</p>

<p>Note: ChangeCipherSpec messages, alerts, and any other record types are not handshake messages and are not included in the hash computations.  Also, HelloRequest messages are omitted from handshake hashes.</p></div></para>
