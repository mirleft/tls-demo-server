   The change cipher spec protocol exists to signal transitions in
   ciphering strategies.  The protocol consists of a single message,
   which is encrypted and compressed under the current (not the pending)
   connection state.  The message consists of a single byte of value 1.

      struct {
          enum { change_cipher_spec(1), (255) } type;
      } ChangeCipherSpec;

   The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent by both the client and the
   server to notify the receiving party that subsequent records will be
   protected under the newly negotiated CipherSpec and keys.  Reception
   of this message causes the receiver to instruct the record layer to
   immediately copy the read pending state into the read current state.
   Immediately after sending this message, the sender MUST instruct the
   record layer to make the write pending state the write active state.
   (See Section 6.1.)  The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent during the
   handshake after the security parameters have been agreed upon, but
   before the verifying Finished message is sent.

   Note: If a rehandshake occurs while data is flowing on a connection,
   the communicating parties may continue to send data using the old
   CipherSpec.  However, once the ChangeCipherSpec has been sent, the
   new CipherSpec MUST be used.  The first side to send the
   ChangeCipherSpec does not know that the other side has finished
   computing the new keying material (e.g., if it has to perform a
   time-consuming public key operation).  Thus, a small window of time,
   during which the recipient must buffer the data, MAY exist.  In
   practice, with modern machines this interval is likely to be fairly
   short.</pre></para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-1-2"><pre>7.4.1.2.  Client Hello

   When this message will be sent:

      When a client first connects to a server, it is required to send
      the ClientHello as its first message.  The client can also send a
      ClientHello in response to a HelloRequest or on its own initiative
      in order to renegotiate the security parameters in an existing
      connection.

   Structure of this message:

      The ClientHello message includes a random structure, which is used
      later in the protocol.

         struct {
             uint32 gmt_unix_time;
             opaque random_bytes[28];
         } Random;

      gmt_unix_time
         The current time and date in standard UNIX 32-bit format
         (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, UTC, ignoring
         leap seconds) according to the sender's internal clock.  Clocks
         are not required to be set correctly by the basic TLS protocol;
         higher-level or application protocols may define additional
         requirements.  Note that, for historical reasons, the data
         element is named using GMT, the predecessor of the current
         worldwide time base, UTC.

      random_bytes
         28 bytes generated by a secure random number generator.

   The ClientHello message includes a variable-length session
   identifier.  If not empty, the value identifies a session between the
   same client and server whose security parameters the client wishes to
   reuse.  The session identifier MAY be from an earlier connection,
   this connection, or from another currently active connection.  The
   second option is useful if the client only wishes to update the
   random structures and derived values of a connection, and the third
   option makes it possible to establish several independent secure
   connections without repeating the full handshake protocol.  These
   independent connections may occur sequentially or simultaneously; a
   SessionID becomes valid when the handshake negotiating it completes
   with the exchange of Finished messages and persists until it is
   removed due to aging or because a fatal error was encountered on a
   connection associated with the session.  The actual contents of the
   SessionID are defined by the server.

      opaque SessionID<0..32>;

   Warning: Because the SessionID is transmitted without encryption or
   immediate MAC protection, servers MUST NOT place confidential
   information in session identifiers or let the contents of fake
   session identifiers cause any breach of security.  (Note that the
   content of the handshake as a whole, including the SessionID, is
   protected by the Finished messages exchanged at the end of the
   handshake.)

   The cipher suite list, passed from the client to the server in the
   ClientHello message, contains the combinations of cryptographic
   algorithms supported by the client in order of the client's
   preference (favorite choice first).  Each cipher suite defines a key
   exchange algorithm, a bulk encryption algorithm (including secret key
   length), a MAC algorithm, and a PRF.  The server will select a cipher
   suite or, if no acceptable choices are presented, return a handshake
   failure alert and close the connection.  If the list contains cipher
   suites the server does not recognize, support, or wish to use, the
   server MUST ignore those cipher suites, and process the remaining
   ones as usual.

      uint8 CipherSuite[2];    /* Cryptographic suite selector */

   The ClientHello includes a list of compression algorithms supported
   by the client, ordered according to the client's preference.

      enum { null(0), (255) } CompressionMethod;

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion client_version;
          Random random;
          SessionID session_id;
          CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
          CompressionMethod compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
          select (extensions_present) {
              case false:
                  struct {};
              case true:
                  Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
          };
      } ClientHello;

   TLS allows extensions to follow the compression_methods field in an
   extensions block.  The presence of extensions can be detected by
   determining whether there are bytes following the compression_methods
   at the end of the ClientHello.  Note that this method of detecting
   optional data differs from the normal TLS method of having a
   variable-length field, but it is used for compatibility with TLS
   before extensions were defined.

   client_version
      The version of the TLS protocol by which the client wishes to
      communicate during this session.  This SHOULD be the latest
      (highest valued) version supported by the client.  For this
      version of the specification, the version will be 3.3 (see
      Appendix E for details about backward compatibility).

   random
      A client-generated random structure.

   session_id
      The ID of a session the client wishes to use for this connection.
      This field is empty if no session_id is available, or if the
      client wishes to generate new security parameters.

   cipher_suites
      This is a list of the cryptographic options supported by the
      client, with the client's first preference first.  If the
      session_id field is not empty (implying a session resumption
      request), this vector MUST include at least the cipher_suite from
      that session.  Values are defined in Appendix A.5.

   compression_methods
      This is a list of the compression methods supported by the client,
      sorted by client preference.  If the session_id field is not empty
      (implying a session resumption request), it MUST include the
      compression_method from that session.  This vector MUST contain,
      and all implementations MUST support, CompressionMethod.null.
      Thus, a client and server will always be able to agree on a
      compression method.

   extensions
      Clients MAY request extended functionality from servers by sending
      data in the extensions field.  The actual "Extension" format is
      defined in Section 7.4.1.4.

   In the event that a client requests additional functionality using
   extensions, and this functionality is not supplied by the server, the
   client MAY abort the handshake.  A server MUST accept ClientHello
   messages both with and without the extensions field, and (as for all
   other messages) it MUST check that the amount of data in the message
   precisely matches one of these formats; if not, then it MUST send a
   fatal "decode_error" alert.

   After sending the ClientHello message, the client waits for a
   ServerHello message.  Any handshake message returned by the server,
   except for a HelloRequest, is treated as a fatal error.</pre></para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-1-3"><pre>7.4.1.3.  Server Hello

   When this message will be sent:

      The server will send this message in response to a ClientHello
      message when it was able to find an acceptable set of algorithms.
      If it cannot find such a match, it will respond with a handshake
      failure alert.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          ProtocolVersion server_version;
          Random random;
          SessionID session_id;
          CipherSuite cipher_suite;
          CompressionMethod compression_method;
          select (extensions_present) {
              case false:
                  struct {};
              case true:
                  Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
          };
      } ServerHello;

   The presence of extensions can be detected by determining whether
   there are bytes following the compression_method field at the end of
   the ServerHello.

   server_version
      This field will contain the lower of that suggested by the client
      in the client hello and the highest supported by the server.  For
      this version of the specification, the version is 3.3.  (See
      Appendix E for details about backward compatibility.)

   random
      This structure is generated by the server and MUST be
      independently generated from the ClientHello.random.

   session_id
      This is the identity of the session corresponding to this
      connection.  If the ClientHello.session_id was non-empty, the
      server will look in its session cache for a match.  If a match is
      found and the server is willing to establish the new connection
      using the specified session state, the server will respond with
      the same value as was supplied by the client.  This indicates a
      resumed session and dictates that the parties must proceed
      directly to the Finished messages.  Otherwise, this field will
      contain a different value identifying the new session.  The server
      may return an empty session_id to indicate that the session will
      not be cached and therefore cannot be resumed.  If a session is
      resumed, it must be resumed using the same cipher suite it was
      originally negotiated with.  Note that there is no requirement
      that the server resume any session even if it had formerly
      provided a session_id.  Clients MUST be prepared to do a full
      negotiation -- including negotiating new cipher suites -- during
      any handshake.

   cipher_suite
      The single cipher suite selected by the server from the list in
      ClientHello.cipher_suites.  For resumed sessions, this field is
      the value from the state of the session being resumed.

   compression_method
      The single compression algorithm selected by the server from the
      list in ClientHello.compression_methods.  For resumed sessions,
      this field is the value from the resumed session state.

   extensions
      A list of extensions.  Note that only extensions offered by the
      client can appear in the server's list.</pre></para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-2"><pre>7.4.2.  Server Certificate

   When this message will be sent:

      The server MUST send a Certificate message whenever the agreed-
      upon key exchange method uses certificates for authentication
      (this includes all key exchange methods defined in this document
      except DH_anon).  This message will always immediately follow the
      ServerHello message.

   Meaning of this message:

      This message conveys the server's certificate chain to the client.

      The certificate MUST be appropriate for the negotiated cipher
      suite's key exchange algorithm and any negotiated extensions.

   Structure of this message:

      opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

      struct {
          ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
      } Certificate;

   certificate_list
      This is a sequence (chain) of certificates.  The sender's
      certificate MUST come first in the list.  Each following
      certificate MUST directly certify the one preceding it.  Because
      certificate validation requires that root keys be distributed
      independently, the self-signed certificate that specifies the root
      certificate authority MAY be omitted from the chain, under the
      assumption that the remote end must already possess it in order to
      validate it in any case.

   The same message type and structure will be used for the client's
   response to a certificate request message.  Note that a client MAY
   send no certificates if it does not have an appropriate certificate
   to send in response to the server's authentication request.

   Note: PKCS #7 [PKCS7] is not used as the format for the certificate
   vector because PKCS #6 [PKCS6] extended certificates are not used.
   Also, PKCS #7 defines a SET rather than a SEQUENCE, making the task
   of parsing the list more difficult.

   The following rules apply to the certificates sent by the server:

   -  The certificate type MUST be X.509v3, unless explicitly negotiated
      otherwise (e.g., [TLSPGP]).

   -  The end entity certificate's public key (and associated
      restrictions) MUST be compatible with the selected key exchange
      algorithm.

      Key Exchange Alg.  Certificate Key Type

      RSA                RSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the
      RSA_PSK            key to be used for encryption (the
                         keyEncipherment bit MUST be set if the key
                         usage extension is present).
                         Note: RSA_PSK is defined in [TLSPSK].

      DHE_RSA            RSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the
      ECDHE_RSA          key to be used for signing (the
                         digitalSignature bit MUST be set if the key
                         usage extension is present) with the signature
                         scheme and hash algorithm that will be employed
                         in the server key exchange message.
                         Note: ECDHE_RSA is defined in [TLSECC].

      DHE_DSS            DSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the
                         key to be used for signing with the hash
                         algorithm that will be employed in the server
                         key exchange message.

      DH_DSS             Diffie-Hellman public key; the keyAgreement bit
      DH_RSA             MUST be set if the key usage extension is
                         present.

      ECDH_ECDSA         ECDH-capable public key; the public key MUST
      ECDH_RSA           use a curve and point format supported by the
                         client, as described in [TLSECC].

      ECDHE_ECDSA        ECDSA-capable public key; the certificate MUST
                         allow the key to be used for signing with the
                         hash algorithm that will be employed in the
                         server key exchange message.  The public key
                         MUST use a curve and point format supported by
                         the client, as described in  [TLSECC].

   -  The "server_name" and "trusted_ca_keys" extensions [TLSEXT] are
      used to guide certificate selection.

   If the client provided a "signature_algorithms" extension, then all
   certificates provided by the server MUST be signed by a
   hash/signature algorithm pair that appears in that extension.  Note
   that this implies that a certificate containing a key for one
   signature algorithm MAY be signed using a different signature
   algorithm (for instance, an RSA key signed with a DSA key).  This is
   a departure from TLS 1.1, which required that the algorithms be the
   same.  Note that this also implies that the DH_DSS, DH_RSA,
   ECDH_ECDSA, and ECDH_RSA key exchange algorithms do not restrict the
   algorithm used to sign the certificate.  Fixed DH certificates MAY be
   signed with any hash/signature algorithm pair appearing in the
   extension.  The names DH_DSS, DH_RSA, ECDH_ECDSA, and ECDH_RSA are
   historical.

   If the server has multiple certificates, it chooses one of them based
   on the above-mentioned criteria (in addition to other criteria, such
   as transport layer endpoint, local configuration and preferences,
   etc.).  If the server has a single certificate, it SHOULD attempt to
   validate that it meets these criteria.

   Note that there are certificates that use algorithms and/or algorithm
   combinations that cannot be currently used with TLS.  For example, a
   certificate with RSASSA-PSS signature key (id-RSASSA-PSS OID in
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo) cannot be used because TLS defines no
   corresponding signature algorithm.

   As cipher suites that specify new key exchange methods are specified
   for the TLS protocol, they will imply the certificate format and the
   required encoded keying information.</pre></para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-3"><pre>7.4.3.  Server Key Exchange Message

   When this message will be sent:

      This message will be sent immediately after the server Certificate
      message (or the ServerHello message, if this is an anonymous
      negotiation).

      The ServerKeyExchange message is sent by the server only when the
      server Certificate message (if sent) does not contain enough data
      to allow the client to exchange a premaster secret.  This is true
      for the following key exchange methods:

         DHE_DSS
         DHE_RSA
         DH_anon

      It is not legal to send the ServerKeyExchange message for the
      following key exchange methods:

         RSA
         DH_DSS
         DH_RSA

      Other key exchange algorithms, such as those defined in [TLSECC],
      MUST specify whether the ServerKeyExchange message is sent or not;
      and if the message is sent, its contents.

   Meaning of this message:

      This message conveys cryptographic information to allow the client
      to communicate the premaster secret: a Diffie-Hellman public key
      with which the client can complete a key exchange (with the result
      being the premaster secret) or a public key for some other
      algorithm.

   Structure of this message:

      enum { dhe_dss, dhe_rsa, dh_anon, rsa, dh_dss, dh_rsa
            /* may be extended, e.g., for ECDH -- see [TLSECC] */
           } KeyExchangeAlgorithm;

      struct {
          opaque dh_p<1..2^16-1>;
          opaque dh_g<1..2^16-1>;
          opaque dh_Ys<1..2^16-1>;
      } ServerDHParams;     /* Ephemeral DH parameters */

      dh_p
         The prime modulus used for the Diffie-Hellman operation.

      dh_g
         The generator used for the Diffie-Hellman operation.

      dh_Ys
         The server's Diffie-Hellman public value (g^X mod p).

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              case dh_anon:
                  ServerDHParams params;
              case dhe_dss:
              case dhe_rsa:
                  ServerDHParams params;
                  digitally-signed struct {
                      opaque client_random[32];
                      opaque server_random[32];
                      ServerDHParams params;
                  } signed_params;
              case rsa:
              case dh_dss:
              case dh_rsa:
                  struct {} ;
                 /* message is omitted for rsa, dh_dss, and dh_rsa */
              /* may be extended, e.g., for ECDH -- see [TLSECC] */
          };
      } ServerKeyExchange;

      params
         The server's key exchange parameters.

      signed_params
         For non-anonymous key exchanges, a signature over the server's
         key exchange parameters.

   If the client has offered the "signature_algorithms" extension, the
   signature algorithm and hash algorithm MUST be a pair listed in that
   extension.  Note that there is a possibility for inconsistencies
   here.  For instance, the client might offer DHE_DSS key exchange but
   omit any DSA pairs from its "signature_algorithms" extension.  In
   order to negotiate correctly, the server MUST check any candidate
   cipher suites against the "signature_algorithms" extension before
   selecting them.  This is somewhat inelegant but is a compromise
   designed to minimize changes to the original cipher suite design.

   In addition, the hash and signature algorithms MUST be compatible
   with the key in the server's end-entity certificate.  RSA keys MAY be
   used with any permitted hash algorithm, subject to restrictions in
   the certificate, if any.

   Because DSA signatures do not contain any secure indication of hash
   algorithm, there is a risk of hash substitution if multiple hashes
   may be used with any key.  Currently, DSA [DSS] may only be used with
   SHA-1.  Future revisions of DSS [DSS-3] are expected to allow the use
   of other digest algorithms with DSA, as well as guidance as to which
   digest algorithms should be used with each key size.  In addition,
   future revisions of [PKIX] may specify mechanisms for certificates to
   indicate which digest algorithms are to be used with DSA.

   As additional cipher suites are defined for TLS that include new key
   exchange algorithms, the server key exchange message will be sent if
   and only if the certificate type associated with the key exchange
   algorithm does not provide enough information for the client to
   exchange a premaster secret.</pre></para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-5"><pre>7.4.5.  Server Hello Done

   When this message will be sent:

      The ServerHelloDone message is sent by the server to indicate the
      end of the ServerHello and associated messages.  After sending
      this message, the server will wait for a client response.

   Meaning of this message:

      This message means that the server is done sending messages to
      support the key exchange, and the client can proceed with its
      phase of the key exchange.

      Upon receipt of the ServerHelloDone message, the client SHOULD
      verify that the server provided a valid certificate, if required,
      and check that the server hello parameters are acceptable.

   Structure of this message:

      struct { } ServerHelloDone;</pre></para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-7"><pre>7.4.7.  Client Key Exchange Message

   When this message will be sent:

      This message is always sent by the client.  It MUST immediately
      follow the client certificate message, if it is sent.  Otherwise,
      it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives
      the ServerHelloDone message.

   Meaning of this message:

      With this message, the premaster secret is set, either by direct
      transmission of the RSA-encrypted secret or by the transmission of
      Diffie-Hellman parameters that will allow each side to agree upon
      the same premaster secret.

      When the client is using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponent,
      then this message contains the client's Diffie-Hellman public
      value.  If the client is sending a certificate containing a static
      DH exponent (i.e., it is doing fixed_dh client authentication),
      then this message MUST be sent but MUST be empty.

   Structure of this message:

      The choice of messages depends on which key exchange method has
      been selected.  See Section 7.4.3 for the KeyExchangeAlgorithm
      definition.

      struct {
          select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
              case rsa:
                  EncryptedPreMasterSecret;
              case dhe_dss:
              case dhe_rsa:
              case dh_dss:
              case dh_rsa:
              case dh_anon:
                  ClientDiffieHellmanPublic;
          } exchange_keys;
      } ClientKeyExchange;</para>
          <para class="rfc-chapter chapter-7-4-9">7.4.9.  Finished

   When this message will be sent:

      A Finished message is always sent immediately after a change
      cipher spec message to verify that the key exchange and
      authentication processes were successful.  It is essential that a
      change cipher spec message be received between the other handshake
      messages and the Finished message.

   Meaning of this message:

      The Finished message is the first one protected with the just
      negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets.  Recipients of Finished
      messages MUST verify that the contents are correct.  Once a side
      has sent its Finished message and received and validated the
      Finished message from its peer, it may begin to send and receive
      application data over the connection.

   Structure of this message:

      struct {
          opaque verify_data[verify_data_length];
      } Finished;

      verify_data
         PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages))
            [0..verify_data_length-1];

      finished_label
         For Finished messages sent by the client, the string
         "client finished".  For Finished messages sent by the server,
         the string "server finished".

      Hash denotes a Hash of the handshake messages.  For the PRF
      defined in Section 5, the Hash MUST be the Hash used as the basis
      for the PRF.  Any cipher suite which defines a different PRF MUST
      also define the Hash to use in the Finished computation.

      In previous versions of TLS, the verify_data was always 12 octets
      long.  In the current version of TLS, it depends on the cipher
      suite.  Any cipher suite which does not explicitly specify
      verify_data_length has a verify_data_length equal to 12.  This
      includes all existing cipher suites.  Note that this
      representation has the same encoding as with previous versions.
      Future cipher suites MAY specify other lengths but such length
      MUST be at least 12 bytes.

      handshake_messages
         All of the data from all messages in this handshake (not
         including any HelloRequest messages) up to, but not including,
         this message.  This is only data visible at the handshake layer
         and does not include record layer headers.  This is the
         concatenation of all the Handshake structures as defined in
         Section 7.4, exchanged thus far.

   It is a fatal error if a Finished message is not preceded by a
   ChangeCipherSpec message at the appropriate point in the handshake.

   The value handshake_messages includes all handshake messages starting
   at ClientHello up to, but not including, this Finished message.  This
   may be different from handshake_messages in Section 7.4.8 because it
   would include the CertificateVerify message (if sent).  Also, the
   handshake_messages for the Finished message sent by the client will
   be different from that for the Finished message sent by the server,
   because the one that is sent second will include the prior one.

   Note: ChangeCipherSpec messages, alerts, and any other record types
   are not handshake messages and are not included in the hash
   computations.  Also, HelloRequest messages are omitted from handshake
   hashes.</pre></para>

   Application data messages are carried by the record layer and are
   fragmented, compressed, and encrypted based on the current connection
   state.  The messages are treated as transparent data to the record
   layer.</pre></para>
